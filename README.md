# A PHP MVC project using medoo database

## Description

This demo is based on Colt Steele's 'Farm Stand' project in his course 'The Web Developer Bootcamp'. [@Colt](https://github.com/Colt)

I have refactored it using PHP and the [Medoo](https://medoo.in/) database framework.

## Installation
- Install dependecies:

  ```bash
  $ composer install
  ```
- Prepare a database. 
- Change the database and mail(trap) credentials in `app/config/config.php`.
